# Floundr: Container Registry + TUI Client

<img src="config/logo.png" alt="logo" width="140" />

**Floundr** is a WIP Docker container registry written in Rust with Axum, and a TUI client built with [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)
The goal is a registry designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to manage, aiming to be fully compliant with
the OCI distribution spec.

## Current State/Existing Features

- **Authentication:** `docker login` is supported, with basic and bearer authentication.
- **Basic Docker Push/Pull:** basic `docker push | pull` commands are supported.
- **TUI Client:** _WIP_ Manage the registry through a terminal-based interface built with Ratatui.
- **Storage Backends:** Local storage is currently supported.

### Roadmap | TODO

- **Complete Specification Compliance**: Floundr aims to be fully compliant with the OCI distribution spec.
- **S3 Storage Driver**: Add support for S3 storage backend.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control and user management in the TUI client.
- **Web-based Dashboard:** A future goal is to build a web interface to complement the TUI.
- **Garbage Collection**: Run garbage collection to remove ref-counted unused layers on a schedule.
