# _oci Extension Endpoints

## Summary

This base extension namespace for OCI namespaced extension endpoints.

## Reference Explanation

### Component: `ext`

This component is for endpoints relating to extensions on the registry API being queried.

#### Module: `discover`

This endpoint may be queried to discover extensions available on this registry API.

Registry-level extensions may be discovered with a standard `GET` as follows.

```HTTP
GET /v2/_oci/ext/discover
```

Repository-level extensions may be discovered with a standard GET as follows.

```HTTP
    GET /v2/{name}/_oci/ext/discover
```

The base extension returns an array of supported extensions with details of the endpoints as shown below.

```HTTP
200 OK
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "extensions": [
        {
            "name": "_<extension>",
            "description": "",
            "url": "..."
        }
    ]    
}
```
